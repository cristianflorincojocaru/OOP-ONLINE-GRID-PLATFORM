A software engineer, a hardware engineer, and a project manager are driving down a steep mountain when their brakes fail. The car careens out of control but miraculously comes to a stop after scraping against the guardrail.  

The project manager says, "We need to form a committee to analyze this and come up with a solution."  

The hardware engineer says, "Letâ€™s take the car apart and find the fault."  

The software engineer says, "How about we push it back up the hill and see if it happens again?" ðŸ˜„
